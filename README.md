# automated-ticket-monitoring-system
This project is a scheduled, automated application that monitors ticket availability on the WB Studio Tour website : https://tickets.wbstudiotour.co.uk/webstore/shop/viewitems.aspx?c=tix2&cg=hptst2 
You can define the frequency and duration of the monitoring process. When an available ticket matching your criteria is detected, the script sends an email notification instantly. This solution is ideal for users aiming to secure high-demand tickets without manual effort, saving time and ensuring timely updates.
